# AWS Kinesis Examples

This project contains examples of how to stream tweets to AWS Kinesis data streams using the SDK v2, Kinesis producer
Library and Kinesis Client Library.

The examples were base on a Pluralsight course
- https://www.pluralsight.com/courses/developing-stream-processing-applications-aws-kinesis

This repo version uses the new version of the v2 of the SDK, and it's written in Scala instead of Java.

I am currently learning Scala and figured this would be a great example to learn Scala. So when you see something which
it's not a good scala practice please let me know.
