# Amazon Kinesis Examples

This project contains examples of how to stream tweets to AWS Kinesis data streams using the SDK v2, Kinesis producer
Library and Kinesis Client Library.

The examples were base on a Pluralsight course
- https://www.pluralsight.com/courses/developing-stream-processing-applications-aws-kinesis

Compared to the code in the course, this repo uses the new version(v2) of the AWS SDK, and it's written in Scala.

I am currently learning Scala and figured this would be a great example to practice Scala. 

Feedback is much appreciated.
